## Questions

### Difficulty Level: Moderate

Most of the concepts to complete the assignment were fairly easy for me. I challenged myself with using Material-UI, which I am less familiar with.

### How did you feel about the exercise itself? (1 lowest, 10 highest—awesome way to assess coding ability)
It's a good simple excercize with various options to customize to show different skills.


### How do you feel about coding an exercise as a step in the interview process?  (1 lowest, 10 highest—awesome way to assess coding ability)
I think it is a great way to gauge both a candidate's skill and their interest in the position.

### What would you change in the exercise and/or process?
The document with the directions could be more polished and clearer. I would put all the instructions in one place, rather than some steps in the email and some in an attachment. (Unless the challenge is also intended to test attention and organization!)
